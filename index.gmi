### quick words
I like to play around with provided assets like images and documents. However, I do not own licenses to the Microsoft and/or Adobe software that is often required for these kinds of things. FOSS software is often enough for me. I wish more assets were provided in non-proprietary file formats.

I give funny looks to people who believe that modern is always better. There is a time and place for everything, but when your web page takes a full minute to load you must reassess your priorities.

Tabs are always better than spaces, except for aligning stuff. Linux kernel style is the only proper way to place brackets. Vim is better than Emacs, but only because no one except Richard bothers with the steep learning curve. I prefer Gnome over KDE. You can be an expert on any programming language and still dislike said language.
